```bash
git init
git clone https://github.com/dominicfanucchi/aai-520_group8.git
```

## Project Objective
The primary objective of the project is to develop a generative chatbot similar to the ones that are broadly used today, but with the expectation that the level of conversation and ability to train the model will be much more limited. Given the use of one of the three provided datasets the groups main objective was balancing  the ability to converse with the model on a more question and answer basis, with some management of general dialogue and natural human language interaction.  

## About the Dataset

## Approach
The specific algorithms and networks used were as follows: 


These algorithms and networks were implemented through Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 

### Imports and Libraries
The project relies on the following libraries and packages:
* `os` - Provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality.
* `warnings` - Provides a way to issue warnings and control their behavior.
* `numpy` - Fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.
* `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis library.
* `matplotlib.pyplot` - Plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
* `%matplotlib inline` - Jupyter magic command for displaying plots inline within Jupyter notebooks.
* `tqdm` - Library for showing progress bars in loops.
