It was a chilly Halloween night, and the full moon bathed Willow Street in an eerie glow. Emily and her friends had dared each other to explore the old, abandoned house at the end of the road. It had stood there for decades, untouched and avoided by the locals, who whispered of ghostly figures and strange sounds coming from inside.

Armed with only flashlights and nervous laughter, the group slowly approached the house. The wooden door creaked open as if it had been expecting them. Inside, the air was thick with dust, and cobwebs hung like curtains. Every step on the old wooden floor echoed through the empty halls, making the friends jump at even the slightest sound.

As they moved deeper into the house, they discovered strange carvings on the wallsâ€”symbols none of them recognized. Suddenly, the temperature dropped, and a soft whisper filled the air, though no one was speaking. "Did you hear that?" Emily asked, her voice trembling.

The others nodded, their faces pale with fear. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, as if calling to them from the very walls. Emily shone her flashlight toward the far end of the hallway, revealing a tall mirror that hadn't been there before.

In the reflection, they saw not themselves but a shadowy figure, its eyes glowing a faint red. The figure moved closer in the mirror, but when they turned around, there was nothing behind them. Panic set in, and they bolted for the door. As they ran out, the door slammed shut on its own, leaving behind only the echo of sinister laughter.

The house on Willow Street remained silent once more, waiting for its next visitors.
